When testing environment variables in a Vite project using Vitest, you have several approaches to ensure your tests run correctly and efficiently. Below are some methods to handle environment variables during testing:

1. Loading Environment Variables with dotenv

To make environment variables accessible in your tests, you can use the dotenv package:

Install dotenv:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install --save-dev dotenv
Configure Vitest to load environment variables:

In your vite.config.ts or vitest.config.ts, add dotenv/config to the setupFiles array:

typescript
Copy
Edit
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    setupFiles: ['dotenv/config'],
  },
});
This setup ensures that all environment variables defined in your .env files are loaded and available during testing.

2. Mocking Environment Variables with vi.stubEnv

For tests that require specific environment variable values, you can mock them using Vitest's vi.stubEnv method:

Stub an Environment Variable:

typescript
Copy
Edit
import { vi, it, expect } from 'vitest';

it('should use the mocked environment variable', () => {
  vi.stubEnv('VITE_API_URL', 'http://mocked-api-url.com');
  expect(import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL).toBe('http://mocked-api-url.com');
});
This approach allows you to set environment variables to desired values for individual tests.

Restore Environment Variables After Tests:

To ensure that mocked environment variables don't affect other tests, restore them after each test:

typescript
Copy
Edit
import { afterEach } from 'vitest';

afterEach(() => {
  vi.unstubAllEnvs();
});
Alternatively, enable automatic restoration by setting unstubEnvs to true in your Vitest configuration:

typescript
Copy
Edit
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    unstubEnvs: true,
  },
});
This configuration ensures that all environment variable stubs are cleared before each test.

3. Using .env.test Files for Test Environments

To manage environment variables specific to your test environment:

Create a .env.test File:

Define test-specific environment variables in a .env.test file at your project's root.

Load the .env.test File in Vitest:

Configure Vitest to load this file during testing by adding dotenv/config to the setupFiles array:

typescript
Copy
Edit
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    setupFiles: ['dotenv/config'],
  },
});
This setup ensures that the environment variables defined in .env.test are loaded during your tests.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage and test environment variables in your Vite and Vitest projects, ensuring consistent and reliable test outcomes.
